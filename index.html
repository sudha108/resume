            <div class="content gray-text">
                Started my professional career with FourKites as a college intern, transitioned into a full-time role,
                and contributed significantly until my maternity break. After a 3-year career pause, I rejoined
                FourKites by clearing the standard interview process. Fourkites is a supply chain management company
                based on US, which uses a proprietary algorithm combined with the world’s broadest data network to
                predict when shipments will arrive at scheduled stops, monitor load temperatures and analyze enterprise

            <ul>
                <li>Boosted <b>regression pass rate</b> from 60% to 90% across pytest and Virtuoso, and significantly
                    extended test coverage to <b>eliminate manual intervention</b> during regression cycles across two
                    different teams — one with limited scenarios and another with extensive, complex workflows </li>
                <li>Legacy test cases and automation code (3–4 years old) written by me are still in active use,
                    demonstrating long-term reliability and maintainability</li>
                <li>Fixed a long-standing(2 years) <b>mock server integration issue</b> in the Test Engine framework,
                    which generated status check combinations (e.g., Picked Up, In Transit) for over 1,000 EDI code
                    mappings across different vendors like FedEx and UPS. The original logic produced more than 10k
                    redundant and invalid combinations using a mathematical approach. After researching the actual use
                    case, I <b>refactored</b> the logic to group statuses into valid sets, reducing the combinations to
                    just 15–20 per vendor, significantly improving test efficiency, reliability, and relevance.</li>
                <li>Automated the previously manual process of safely copying production data for testing, implementing

                    acquisition and graceful error handling</li>
                <li>Utilised <b>JSR223 (Groovy)</b> to extract and parse API responses and pass data across APIs

                    sequential execution of dependent APIs</li>
                <li>Developed Go scripts to fetch metrics from Chronosphere and compare them against thresholds defined
                    in CSV files, helping validate system performance and detect anomalies</li>
